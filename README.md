# MACHINE LEARNING
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.
# TYPES OF ML ALGORITHMS
1. Supervised Learning
       Regression
       Classification
2. Unsupervised Learning
       Clustering
       Dimensionality Reduction
3. Reinforcement Learning
   
# TASK 1 [MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION]
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
# STEPS INVOLVED 
1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Load training data
3. Cleaning the data
4. Split the data into training and validation sets
5. Preprocess the data (TF-IDF vectorization)
6. Train a Logistic Regression classifier with optimized hyperparameters
7. Predict on the validation set
8. Load the test data for prediction and clean the data
9. Make predictions on the test data.
